I have moved these efforts to my soapybrain engine work.  https://github.com/thegreatpissant/soapybrain

My OpenGL projects
* Projects
  All of the sub projects located here are part of my learning trials.
  A solid project idea will get spun out.
** openglbook
   An online tutorial I was going through
** opengl-programming-guide
   The updated defacto std to learing opengl.  This is turning into
   more then just the book examples.  Some other items for developing
   parts to a game or rendering engine are creeping in.
** opengl-wikibook 
   An online tutorial I was going through
** pre3
   Items I had tried from a OpenGL 1.X series perspective.
** tests
   Various tests
* Requires
  - glew
  - glm
  - freeglut
  - video card supporting at least opengl 2.0
* Building
  All current work is happening in the opengl-programming-guide directory
  > cd opengl-programming-guide
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ../
  > make 
  Then run the programs
